# Configure for restricted use

SumatraPDF can be configured for restricted use. 

A restricted mode is useful if you want to use SumatraPDF as a bundled viewer for your program's documentation or in kiosk mode

In restricted mode some actions that are not appropriate in such context are disabled:

- opening new files
- launching URLs from with PDF document
- text and image selection
- printing
- changing default settings
- saving to disk
- automatic and manual update checks
- a history of recently opened files
- TeX preview support
- registering as a default PDF viewer
- opening with Adobe Acrobat
- e-mailing PDF

To restrict SumatraPDF put file `sumatrapdfrestrict.ini` in the same directory where `SumatraPDF.exe` is.

Here's a [full documentation of available options](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/blob/master/docs/sumatrapdfrestrict.ini).
