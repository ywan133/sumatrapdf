# Using DrMemory

[DrMemory](https://drmemory.org/) is a tool for detecting memory errors and misuse of Windows APIs.

I've tried portable version [1.8.1RC1](https://github.com/DynamoRIO/drmemory/wiki/Downloads) on Windows 7 32bit (it doesn't support Windows 10 and 64bit).

I ran it as:

- `mkdir ..\drmemlogs`
- `..\drmemory\bin\drmemory.exe -logdir ..\drmemlogs -suppress=drmem-sup.txt â€”   .\rel\SumatraPDF.exe ..\f1.pdf`

There are what appear to be false positives. I add suppressions to drmem-sup.txt as I find them.

DrMemory visibly slows down the program and also crashes sometimes (e.g. it crashed for me with XPS files).
