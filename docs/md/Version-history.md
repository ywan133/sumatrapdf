## Version history

### next (3.6)

Changes in [pre-release builds](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/prerelease):

- improved zooming:
  - zooming with pinch touch screen gesture or with ctrl + scroll wheel now zooms around the mouse position and does continuous zoom levels. Used to zoom around top-left corner and progress fixed zoom levels shown in menu
- include manual (`F1` to launch browser with documentation)
- add `LazyLoading` advanced setting, defaults to true. When restoring a session lazy loading delays loading a file until its tab is selected. Makes SumatraPDF startup faster.
- new commands in command palette (`Ctrl + K`):
  - `CmdCloseAllTabs` : "Close All Tabs"
  - `CmdCloseTabsToTheLeft` : "Close Tabs To The Left"
  - `CmdDeleteFile`: "Delete File"
  - `CmdToggleFrequentlyRead` : "Toggle Frequently Read"
  - `CmdToggleLinks` : "Toggle Show Links"
  - `CmdInvokeInverseSearch`
  - `CmdMoveTabRight` (`Ctrl + Shift + PageUp`), `CmdMoveTabLeft` (`Ctrl + Shift + PageDown`) to move tabs left / right, like in Chrome
- add ability to provide arguments to some commands when creating bindings in `Shortcuts`:
  - CmdCreateAnnot\* commands take a color argument, `openedit` to automatically open edit annotations window when creating an annotation, `copytoclipboard` to copy selection to clipboard and `setcontent` to set contents of annotation to selection
  - `CmdScrollDown`, `CmdScrollUp` : integer argument, how many lines to scroll
  - `CmdGoToNextPage`, `CmdGoToPrevPage` : integer argument, how many pages to advance
  - `CmdNextTabSmart`, `CmdPrevTabSmart` (`Smart Tab Switch`), shortcut: `Ctrl + Tab`, `Ctrl + Shift + Tab``
- added `UIFontSize` advanced setting
- removed `TreeFontWeightOffset` advanced setting
- increase number of thumbnails on home page from 10 => 30
- add `ShowLinks` advanced setting and "Toggle Show Links" (`CmdToggleLinks`) for command palette
- default `ReuseInstance` setting to true
- added `Key` arg to `ExternalViewers` advanced setting (keyboard shortcut)
- added `Key` arg to `SelectionHandlers` advanced setting (keyboard shortcut)
- improved scrolling with mouse wheel and touch gestures
- theming improvements
- go back to opening settings file with default .txt editor (notepad most likely)
- don't exit fullscreen on double-click. must double-click in upper-right corner
- when opening via double-click, if `Ctrl` is pressed will always open in new tab (vs. activating existing tab)
- register for handling `.webp` files
- bug fix: Del should not delete an annotation if editing content
- bug fix: re-enable tree view full row select
- change: `CmdCreateAnnotHighlight` etc. no longer copies selection to clipboard by default. To get that behavior back, you can use `copytoclipboard` argument [instead](Commands.md#cmdcreateannothighlight-and-other-cmdcreateannot).
- change: `Ctrl + Tab` is now `CmdNextTabSmart`, was `CmdNextTab`. `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` is now `CmdPrevTabSmart`, was `CmdPrevTab`. You can [re-bind it](Customizing-keyboard-shortcuts.md) if you prefer old behavior
- `CmdCommandPalette` takes optional `mode` argument: `@` for tab selection, `#` for selecting from file history and `>` for commands.
- command palette no longer shows combined tabs/file history/commands. `CmdCommandPalette` only shows commands. Because of that removed `CmdCommandPaletteNoFiles` because now ``CmdCommandPalette` behaves like it
- removed `CmdCommandPaletteOnlyTabs`, replaced by`CmdCommandPaletteNoFiles @`
- `Ctrl + Shift + K` no longer active, use `Ctrl + K`. You can restore this shortcut by binding it to `CmdCommandPalette >` command.
- add `Name` field for shortcuts. If given, the command will show up in Command Palette (`Ctrl + K`)
- closing a current tab now behaves like in Chrome: selects next tab (to the right). We used to select previously active tab, but that's unpredicable and we prefer to align SumatraPDF behavior with other popular apps.
- swapped key bindings: 'i' is now CmdTogglePageInfo, 'I' is CmdInvertColors. Several people were confused by accidentally typing 'i' to invert colors, is less likely to type it accidentally
- allow creating custom themes in advanced settings in `Themes` section. [See docs](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/docs/Customize-theme-colors).
- improve scrolling with middle click drag [#4529](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/4529)
