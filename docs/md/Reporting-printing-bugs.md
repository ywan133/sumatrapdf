# Reporting printing bugs

Printing bugs are hard to diagnose because each printer has a different printer driver, so the same file can print well on one printer and not print on another printer.

That's why when reporting printing bugs in [https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues), please make sure to include the following information:

- version of Sumatra
- version of the OS (e.g. windows Vista, windows 10 etc.)
- name of the printer
- can you open and see the file in Sumatra?
- what exactly happens, are there any error messages?
- if it happens only for some files but not the others
    - is there anything different about the files that don't print that jumps out?
    - please attach the file that doesn't print to bug report. If the file is confidential you can e-mail it to [kkowalczyk@gmail.com](mailto:kkowalczyk@gmail.com) ([Krzysztof Kowalczyk](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/), Sumatra's main developer).
