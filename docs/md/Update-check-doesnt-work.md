# Update check doesn't work?

A new version of Sumatra has been released, you `Help -> Check for updates` menu and it didn't notify about a new release. Is this a bug?

Most likely not.

We wait at least a week before activating update check. That way, if there is a major problem with a new release that we didn't catch in testing, less people will have to re-download the update that fixes the problem.
