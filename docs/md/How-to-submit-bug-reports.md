# How to submit bug reports

Did you encounter a bug in SumatraPDF?

## Check in latest pre-release build

First, see if it still happens in latest [pre-release version](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/prerelease). It's possible that a bug has already been fixed there.

## Create an issue

If the problem is present in latest [pre-release build](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/prerelease), please create a bug report in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues).

## Provide a test file

Does it involve a specific PDF (or CHM or XPS) file? 

Please attach it to the issue (try dragging and dropping on the issue field). Without a test document we rarely can make progress on fixing the issue.

If the file (or other information) is confidential, you can e-mail it directly to [kkowalczyk@gmail.com](mailto:kkowalczyk@gmail.com) ([Krzysztof Kowalczyk](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/), SumatraPDF's main developer).

## Provide reproduction steps

Often the bug only happens in a specific scenario.

If possible, please provide step-by-step instructions for reproducing the the issue.
